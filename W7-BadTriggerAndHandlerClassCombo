//We're calling this 'BadAccountTrigger' because this trigger has business logic directly coded in the trigger file. It's also using
//way more parameters (on line 7) than it actually uses in the trigger itself. Both of these are considered bad practice. 
//Business logic coded directly in a trigger and having extra stuff in your code both make the code hard to read and hard to maintain.  
//The 'GoodAccountTrigger' shows how to use a handler class with your trigger and is much simpler to read.
